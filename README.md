# FOOD-DELIVERY-MVC-JAVA-APP
Unfinished project of a food delivery app in MVC, to study, use or facilitate programmers' routine. The code is all commented in Portuguese (BR) and outlines the purest and cleanest concept of application development in native java with animated screen transitions with threads. Everything done by hand without the need for a framework.
